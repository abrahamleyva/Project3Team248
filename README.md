WEBCAM WITH FILTERS

Ideas: The missions of the project is to provide users the ability to have live filters such as those of Snapchat.

How it works:

The user should be greated with our GUI.
    1. Pick a filter
    2. Once you choose a filter, the camara is activated.
    3. A countdown will start (17s) and then the camera will take a picture
    4. The picture is going to be saved in the same directory as the python files.

We started doing border filters, so if we should do any future works this would be it. Or maybe exchanging faces with different real picutres (face swaps).
